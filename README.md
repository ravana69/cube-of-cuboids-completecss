Taking this other <a href="https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/wvEBBab">pen</a> as a base and repeating the same structure within each new cube, the gap left by the initial cube is filled. In addition I have added two more cubes (white) to fill the corner gaps that otherwise would never be filled by many new cubes we added, like in a strange kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge">Menger Sponge</a>...

More cubes can be added <em>ad infinitum</em>, although there comes a time when they cannot be distinguished from how small they are.

By the way, does anyone know how to convert the pug lines that are repeated inside each other to a loop...? I tried it but it didn't work, and I don't know why, but I'm sure it can be done...
